      <p>BeanJS is a full stack open source framework for using SQL with Node. BeanJS is build on the very powerful Bookshelf.js. Inspired by the superb <a href="https://github.com/meanjs/mean">MeanJS</a>.</p>

<p>MeanJS is a great project and throughly recommended, however using a NoSQL solution isn't always the best option which is where this framework comes in. </p>

<p>BeanJS is extremely lightweight and ideal for getting small projects off the ground quickly without all the initial baggage found in other frameworks. </p>

<a id="before-you-begin" class="anchor" href="#before-you-begin" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Before You Begin</h2>

<p>Read about the building blocks for the BeanJS application: </p>

<ul>
<li>Bookshelf.JS - Go through <a href="http://bookshelfjs.org/">Bookshelf.js Official Website</a> and look at their API documentation.</li>
<li>Express - The best way to understand express is through its <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Official Website</a>, particularly <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html">The Express Guide</a>; you can also go through this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js">StackOverflow Thread</a> for more resources.</li>
<li>AngularJS - Angular's <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Official Website</a> is a great starting point. You can also use <a href="http://www.thinkster.io/">Thinkster Popular Guide</a>, and the <a href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead Videos</a>.</li>
<li>Node.js - Start by going through <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js Official Website</a> and this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js">StackOverflow Thread</a>, which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Node.js - <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/download/">Download &amp; Install Node.js</a> and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this <a href="https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814">Github Gist</a> to install Node.js.</li>
<li>Postgres / mySQL / any SQL engine - Install your required database engine and checkout later how to set it up</li>
<li>Bower - You're going to use the <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower Package Manager</a> to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g bower
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Grunt - You're going to use the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt Task Runner</a> to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="quick-install" class="anchor" href="#quick-install" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Install</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM &amp; Package.json section.</p>

<p>To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="configure-your-db-engine" class="anchor" href="#configure-your-db-engine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configure your DB engine</h2>

<p>BeanJS is relational database agnostic but there is a couple off steps that needs to be done for your particular Database Engine:</p>

<p>First Edit your configs files in /app/config/env  (development.js,production.js and test.js needs to be edited).</p>

<p>Then configure your database engine with the same settings and your are all set ready to go.</p>

<h2>
<a id="running-your-application" class="anchor" href="#running-your-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running Your Application</h2>

<p>After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:</p>

<pre><code>$ grunt
</code></pre>

<p>Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="contribution" class="anchor" href="#contribution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribution</h2>

<p>This project is still fairly early in development so we're always looking for contributions!</p>
